# React Todo App

This is a simple Todo application built using React.js and Vite. The app allows users to add, update, delete, and store their tasks in the browser's local storage.

## Features

- **Add Todos**: Create new tasks and add them to your list.
- **Update Todos**: Edit existing tasks to keep your list up-to-date.
- **Delete Todos**: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Persistent Storage**: Your tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so they remain available even after you refresh or close the browser.
